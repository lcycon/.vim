There is an article in lifehacker, which explained how the brain will retain 
information just learnt, longer, if there is at least a twenty minute period
between reading or learning new information. When I am on the internet for 
the millions hours a day that I am, I am switching from article to article,
farting cat video to farting cat video, within seconds of one another. This 
can't be helpful for my seemingly bad memory. This is another example of how
the internet, despite its limitless potential, how been a dirge on my ability
to facilitate knowledge. I have to do something about this. I believe I read
about an app that preventing a webbrowser from switching to another page 
until a timer runs out. This might help. I need to disciplin myself to finish
tasks before moving on to new ones. I need to develop good habbits. I should 
also read more from paper. Luckily I at least have billie to force me to go 
outside a few times a day. I guess I don't spend THAT much time on the computer
but I spend more than I should. And I want to become more productive. I also
need to finish that Ayn Rand scholarship. Yes, I should finish that. 

So, todolist:
    1. Read lecture notes from monday
    2. Read lecture ntoes from thursday
    3. Finish project 2 for computer science.
    4. Finish a MATLAB assignment. 
    5. Start on Atlas Shrugged paper (Thesis statement by the end of the weekend).
